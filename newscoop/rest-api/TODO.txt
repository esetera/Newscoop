- Add to queries also properties so you can map simple unique per query data, like offset and limit
- The call input types should be only Types of property, model or query not allow simple unlinked types.
- The model should not accept linked property types that are not id types.

- To do a sweep and explicitly dictate what attributes should not be changed, see types, or to add a variable 
  protector for debug mode like a decorator with a list specification on what to allow the change for. Or 
  even better remake the __import__ to guard all classes marked din an AOP manner like newscoop.*
