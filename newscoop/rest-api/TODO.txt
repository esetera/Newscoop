- The model should not accept linked property types that are not id types.
- In the parameter encoders for the query encoder we can make also processors to handle the different type of inputs
  for instance a OrderCriteriaHandler, SimpleCriteriaHandler ... Also the arguments and parameters might be wrapped
  in classes to provide additional functionality, this way for instance the parameter grouping will not be repeated in
  other classes.
