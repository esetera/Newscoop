  <li><h3>Check the manual.</h3>
  <p>Seriously, <a href="http://manuals.sourcefabric.org/" target="_blank">our manuals</a> are great and chances are youâ€™ll find the answers to your questions in them. Not there? Read on... (*)</p></li>
  <li><h3>Post to the forum.</h3>

Google or Facebook account) and post your support query in the Newscoop 
forum. Minutes later (timezone/caffeine level dependent), a Sourcefabric
 angel will answer your prayers. If they couldn't, continue reading...
